Hi,

As the Series Editor for the Park City Mathematics Institute Graduate
Lecture Series, I am responsible for seeing that the lecture notes are
prepared in a timely manner.  

The materials you will need to prepare your notes for publication are
contained in the zip file, pcmistyle.zip.  All files referred to below
are in this zip file.

There are two important guidelines:

* Use LaTeX, together with the document class file pcms-l.cls, which
  is attached.  This class allows you to prepare your notes in either
  a lecture style or an article style.  We prefer that you use our
  lecture style.  The document "Preparation of PCMI Lecture Notes"
  (pcmistyle.pdf in pcmistyle.zip) and its LaTeX source pcmistyle.tex
  illustrate this style.  The two styles are explained in "Preparation
  of PCMI Lecture Notes."  Also included are two templates,
  pcms-l-lecture.template and pcms-l-article.template, which can be
  used as starting points for your lectures.

* Be aware that our publisher, the American Mathematical Society, puts
  stringent restrictions on graphics.  These are explained in more
  detail in the AMS document creating-graphics.pdf, but the two key
  points are:

  * All graphics must be in gray scale.  If you have a graphic 
    for which color is absolutely essential we will try to 
    accomodate you, but try gray scale first.

  * In line drawings, all black lines must have a linewidth of at
    least 0.5 points, and gray lines must be at least 1.0 points wide.
    This restriction applies to the graphic as it appears in the final
    document, taking into account any scaling you do in TeX.
  
The document "Preparation of PCMI Lecture Notes" {pcmistyle.pdf)
provides detailed instructions for the use of the class file, for the
preparation of graphics, and other information that might be of use to
you in the preparation of your lecture notes.  It has been prepared in
our lecture style, so it will give you an idea of what to expect your
notes to look like.  The source file, pcmistyle.tex, provides you an
example of how to prepare your own document.

The mathematics editors for your lecture series are the organizers of
the PCMI Summer School.  When your documents are ready to be submitted
send a pdf version to the mathematics editors.  In addition, send your
.tex file, and macro files, all graphics files, and the pdf version
compressed into one file (.zip, .sit, or .tar.gz) to me as the Series
Editor.

Please feel free to call on me for help.  The best way to reach me is
by email at polking@rice.edu.
